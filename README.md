# New Front-End Developer

> Host your version of this repository on [Github](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) or another platform. Make sure it's publicly available. Share the link to the finished exercise.

This is an exercise to test your **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **React** knowledge. Limit the time you spend on this exercise to 3 hours. Don't worry if you're unable to finish in time. You should, however, be able to explain how you would finish the exercise ‚Äî and why you would do it that way ‚Äî if you're given more time. Remember, there is **no correct solution**. There will be plenty of time during the interview to give context to the shortcuts you made.

## Introduction

To keep things light ‚Äî and because the API is publicly available ‚Äî you'll be working with Pok√©mon üéâ. The goal is to develop a single-page application (SPA) that allows you to:

- [Select a Pok√©mon](#select-a-pok√©mon)
- [Select moves](#select-the-moves) for that Pok√©mon to learn (limited to 4 moves)
- [Add the selected Pok√©mon to your squad](#add-to-your-squad) (limited to 6 Pok√©mon)

## Specifications

### Select a Pok√©mon

Use the [GraphQL API](#graphql-api) to get a list of all Pok√©mon. Add a text input to filter the list. Pok√©mon whose name match ‚Äî or partially match ‚Äî the input value remain visible. All other Pok√©mon have to be removed from the list. Clicking a Pok√©mon marks it as selected and displays it in the details section.

### Select the moves

Use the [GraphQL API](#graphql-api) to get the selected Pok√©mon's details: name, image, stats, abilities and type. Present the stats in a 2x3 grid. Divide the moves (abilities) by way of learning: level-up, tutor, egg and machine. Note that not all Pok√©mon have all 4 types of moves. Clicking a move adds it to the list of selected moves. Clicking an already selected move removes it from the list. Limit the number of moves to 4.

### Add to squad

Add a "Save Pok√©mon" button. Clicking the button adds the selected Pok√©mon ‚Äî with its selected moves ‚Äî to your squad. Limit the squad to 6 Pok√©mon.

## Technical details

The master branch is your starter kit for the exercise. Clone it and run `yarn` followed by `yarn start`. This should present you with a ready-to-go application. Use the _src_ and _public_ folder to edit or add code.

**Note**: the package.json includes a predefined set of dependencies. **Feel free to add or remove packages** as needed. Use as much open source components as you like. We recommend [Downshift](https://github.com/paypal/downshift) for the autocomplete UI. You can use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling. As long as you're able to justify your choices nothing is off limits.

### Prerequisites

This exercise requires [Node >= 12](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn 1](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

### Commands

The build command will bundle all assets and output a static version of the website in the _build_ folder. The start command will serve the website and watch for changes.

- install: `yarn`
- build: `yarn build`
- start: `yarn start`

### GraphQL API

The GraphQL endpoint URL is `https://p5k91xxvoq.sse.codesandbox.io/`. It's available in your application as `process.env.REACT_APP_POKE_ENDPOINT`. You can use the [Graphql playground](https://p5k91xxvoq.sse.codesandbox.io/) as a documentation resource or to get familiar with the API.

You'll need two queries to build your application: one for listing all Pok√©mons and one for getting a Pok√©mon's details:

#### Pok√©mon List

```gql
Pokemons(first: 151) {
  id
  name
}
```

#### Pok√©mon Details

```gql
Pokemon(name: "snorlax") {
  id
  name
  image
  abilities {
    name
  }
  stats {
    name
    value
  }
  types {
    name
  }
}
```
